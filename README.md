# Async server development in Rust

These are my slides from my async Rust talk from GOTOcph in 2018. To build the slides, you need to have `pandoc` installed. Then simply run `make`.

Alternatively, you can see the pre-rendered version [here](https://asquera.github.io/goto-async-rust-2018/rust-async.html)
